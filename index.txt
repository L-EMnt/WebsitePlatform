		The University of the West Indies (UWI) has run the D.M. Emergency Medicine programme 
		since 1990. The programme began in Barbados initially in 1990. In 1997, due primarily 
		to the efforts of Professor Archibald McDonald, the programme became available at the 
		Mona campus. Trinidad began offering the programme for the first time starting in January 2005.</p></center>
